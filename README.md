# MacromolecularSimulations
This repository contains curated and well-documented code examples developed to accompany the book "Macromolecular Simulations".
The goal of this collection is to provide readers, students, and researchers with hands-on tools to implement, explore, 
and extend the core algorithms and simulation techniques presented in the text.

**Intended Audience:** This repository is designed for:

Advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering.
Researchers interested in developing their own simulation codes
Instructors looking for project-based or lab-ready content for computational modeling courses.

**Scope:** The repository spans a variety of computational techniques and modeling strategies commonly used
in the study of macromolecular systems, including:

- Coarse-grained and atomistic representations,
- Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations,
- Polymer chain construction algorithms,
- Thermodynamic and structural property calculations,
- Clustering and trajectory analysis,
- Integration with file formats such as LAMMPS, XYZ, and XTC

**Version:** 1st edition

**How do I get set up?**
Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific task presented in the book and includes:

- Source code (mostly C++, Python, or both)
- Input files and example datasets
- README files with usage instructions
- Annotated references to sections of the book
