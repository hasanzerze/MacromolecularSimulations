# MacromolecularSimulations
This repository contains curated and well-documented code examples developed to accompany the book "Macromolecular Simulations". The goal of this collection is to provide readers, students, and researchers with hands-on tools to implement, explore, and extend the core algorithms and simulation techniques presented in the text.
